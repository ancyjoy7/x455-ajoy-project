                Reality Check: Edward Yang’s Living Creatures Do “A One and a Two”
                by <a href="#">Indie Wire</a> <span class="excerpt-tag">[Excerpt]</span>
            </h2>

            <p>
                With a Cannes best director award and a U.S. distribution deal from
                Winstar, Taiwanese director Edward Yang has finally graduated from
                offbeat critics’ pick to art-house contender. But despite the formality
                of Winstar’s conference room, the constant ringing cell phones, the
                buzz of journalists waiting outside, and the sprinkling of white in his
                hair, the 53-year-old Yang comes off as boyish rather than masterful.
            </p>

            <p>
                In response to a question which must seem plenty tired by now – “How did
                winning best director at this year’s Cannes Film Festival change your
                life?” – Edward Yang replies with a burst of spontaneous laughter. “It
                didn’t change much in my life, as far as I know,” he says. “It feels
                more like a graduation than winning the lottery. You’ve earned your
                stripes but you still have to work hard from now on.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Though Yang’s films received critical acclaim since the early 1980s,
                U.S. distribution has proved far more elusive. His new film,
                <em>Yi Yi – A One and a Two</em> – about a tumultuous few weeks in the
                life of a Taipei family – may change all that. While it’s certainly
                more accessible than some of his earlier work, <em>Yi Yi</em> still
                has all the hallmarks of a Yang masterpiece: a reflective tone, an
                eye for the long shot, understated acting, and an intricate narrative
                structure built over nearly three hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to Yang, using close-ups for the interview is simply a waste
                of the visual potential of cinema. Yang’s ideas about acting and
                cinematography are made concrete in the performance of Wu Nien-jen
                (writer and actor) as the dissatisfied patriarch, NJ. Wu is able to
                convey more emotion and experience with his back shuffling up a flight
                of stairs in long shot than most actors can give in a close-up.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yang, who has known and collaborated with Wu Nien-jen for twenty
                years, thinks that the veteran screenwriter’s skills as a performer
                have always been overlooked. “Deep down he has another talent, which
                no one else has given him a chance to use,” says Yang. “The best thing
                about him is his acting skill, plus his ability to understand human
                conditions and relationships. Those things are the hardest part of
                acting.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to foster this fast, intuitive mode of filmmaking, Yang has
                developed a kind of repertory company. He has worked with the same
                editor, sound man, and other collaborators for almost ten years. It’s
                no accident that Yang’s way of working is almost diametrically opposed
                to the current Hollywood model.
